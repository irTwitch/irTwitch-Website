# IrTwitch

IrTwitch was a website that allowed users to access Iranian Twitch live streams. This website was developed using PHP and Lumen.

In July 2022, the Iranian government blocked access to Twitch within Iran, causing significant inconvenience for Iranian Twitch viewers who were unable to watch their favorite streams. In response to this situation, we developed a new website using PHP and Lumen. This website is designed to retrieve live stream videos from Twitch and broadcast them in real-time on our platform, effectively bypassing the filtering imposed by the Iranian government. However, it's important to note that in order to replay the streams, streamers must grant us permission to do so.

Since its launch, the website has gained popularity, attracting over 55,000 unique viewers per month.
